# SAT
Real-time Embedded System Schedulability Analysis Tool  

In order to provide a simple way to compute WCRT and threshold priority, we develop an schedulability analysis tool (SAT) based on the Debian 6.0 under the QT integrated development environment. The main functions of SAT are thresholds calculation, tasks execution, and tasks running statistics. The source code, executable file and four testing benchmarks can be download for free. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
