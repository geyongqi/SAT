# SAT
Real-time Embedded System Schedulability Analysis Tool  

In order to visualize the thresholds priority assignment, we develop an schedulability analysis tool (SAT) based on the Debian 6.0 under the QT integrated development environment. The main functions of SAT are thresholds calculation, tasks execution, and tasks running statistics. The following shows the source code, executable file and four testing benchmarks. They are free to download. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
